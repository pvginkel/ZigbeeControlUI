We just implemented the feature described in the attached plan.

Please do a thorough code review following these steps:

1. Make sure the plan was correctly implemented.
2. Look for any obvious bugs or issues with the code.
3. Look for any over-engineering or files getting too large and needing refactoring.
4. Look for any weird syntax or style that doesn't match other parts of the codebase.

Document your findings in `docs/features/<FEATURE>/code_review.md`.
