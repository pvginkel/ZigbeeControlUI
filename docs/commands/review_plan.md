We got a plan to implement a new feature. We have to review whether this plan is ready for implementation.

You have to look whether the plan conforms to:

- @docs/commands/plan_feature.md
- @docs/product_brief.md
- @AGENTS.md

And you have to check whether the plan fits within the current codebase.

Next you have to look at these aspects:

- Are there any outstanding questions
- Are there any ambiguities
- Does the plan say what we're attempting to do
- Does the plan cover all aspects of what it sets out to do

DO NOT review minor implementation details like:
- Missing import statements
- Exact error message wording
- Minor code style issues
- Specific variable names

Assume a competent developer will handle these details during implementation.

Report your findings back to the user. The user has to decide how to handle your findings.
